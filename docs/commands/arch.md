## Command `arch`

`arch` manages the loaded architecture.

There are 3 available sub-commands:
- `list`: List the installed architectures.
- `get`: This prints the currently loaded architecture, and why it is selected.
- `set`: You can manually set the loaded architecture by providing its name as an argument, or let
  gef do magic to detect the architecture by not providing arguments.
